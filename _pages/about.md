°˖✿˚ ˖⋆Hi! ˖⋆˚✿˖°

My name is Ana Jovanovic-Harrington. I am a PhD candidate at Dublin City University School of Communications, set to graduate in 2026. 

˚ʚ👩🏻‍💻📓✍🏻💡ɞ˚ 

My research explores the relationship between media and politics, specifically in the context of regime changes from democracy to autocracy. The area of my interest is Central and Southern Eastern Europe, and the period is from 2010 and onwards.

˚ʚ👩🏻‍🎓🏫📑🎒ɞ˚ 

I also hold a joint master’s degree in political science from the University of Bologna and Zagreb (MIREES) and a bachelor’s degree in French language and literature from the University of Sarajevo. 

˚ʚ˚👩🏻‍🏫💼📚🤓ɞ˚ 

Committed to education beyond traditional settings, I have also been working as a part-time civil servant in Ireland since 2023 at the Dublin and Dún Laoghaire Education & Training Board, where she design and deliver courses that equip vulnerable communities with skills to combat online misinformation and navigate digital spaces safely. Moreover, I have been an active member of Humanity in Action in my native Bosnia and Herzegovina since 2016, after completing the John Lewis Fellowship. Since 2022, I have been supervising undergraduate research-based policy projects aimed at boosting civic engagement and active democratic participation. In short, I am passionate about blending activism and academia, which is why I focus on under-researched topics whose operationalisation is essential for building democratic resilience.

My research deals broadly with changes to media systems that parallel regime change to autocracy. In Central and South Eastern Europe these changes were most evident from 2010 and onwards. Therefore, although based on two established streams of literature, media systems framework and regime change, my research also intersects with the new and growing field of digital authoritarianism. 

The adaptability and flexibility of modern autocracies are arguably most visible in the way they use digital spaces. In the past, autocracies would officially ban and restrict access to information. Moreover, by default, on the Internet, national actors cannot dictate all content present. It is, therefore, reasonable to assume modern autocracies would officially restrict access to the Internet or ban it altogether. Yet, counterintuitively, that is not the case in most modern autocracies. Instead, autocratic incumbents found ways to use the digital space to their advantage.

Currently working on:
======
In the following months, I plan to publish parts of my thesis as papers, delving into specific tactics modern autocrats use in the digital sphere. First, in cooperation with my supervisor, Dr. Alessio Cornia, I am working on a paper to operationalise and situate the use of Botnet malware and more sophisticated networks of coordinated inauthentic behaviour. 

The second draft in progress focuses on the intersection of the physical and digital, describing the new (and old in a way) tactic of incumbents using state funds and connections to drive undesirable broadband providers out of business. However, as this is an ongoing process, it is unclear what happens once their goal is achieved.

Create content & metadata
------
For site content, there is one markdown file for each type of content, which are stored in directories like _publications, _talks, _posts, _teaching, or _pages. For example, each talk is a markdown file in the [_talks directory](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/_talks). At the top of each markdown file is structured data in YAML about the talk, which the theme will parse to do lots of cool stuff. The same structured data about a talk is used to generate the list of talks on the [Talks page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks), each [individual page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks/2012-03-01-talk-1) for specific talks, the talks section for the [CV page](https://academicpages.github.io/cv), and the [map of places you've given a talk](https://academicpages.github.io/talkmap.html) (if you run this [python file](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.py) or [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.ipynb), which creates the HTML for the map based on the contents of the _talks directory).

**Markdown generator**

I have also created [a set of Jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/markdown_generator
) that converts a CSV containing structured data about talks or presentations into individual markdown files that will be properly formatted for the academicpages template. The sample CSVs in that directory are the ones I used to create my own personal website at stuartgeiger.com. My usual workflow is that I keep a spreadsheet of my publications and talks, then run the code in these notebooks to generate the markdown files, then commit and push them to the GitHub repository.

How to edit your site's GitHub repository
------
Many people use a git client to create files on their local computer and then push them to GitHub's servers. If you are not familiar with git, you can directly edit these configuration and markdown files directly in the github.com interface. Navigate to a file (like [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_talks/2012-03-01-talk-1.md) and click the pencil icon in the top right of the content preview (to the right of the "Raw | Blame | History" buttons). You can delete a file by clicking the trashcan icon to the right of the pencil icon. You can also create new files or upload files by navigating to a directory and clicking the "Create new file" or "Upload files" buttons.
